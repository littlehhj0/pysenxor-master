PySenXor is a Python library for interacting with Meridian Innovationâ€™s camera
modules and thermal imaging processors.
PySenXor aims to bring you a great thermal imaging stream out of the box
with a few lines of code, and enable you to focus on the processing
and analytics of the thermal data for the application you're trying to
enhance by adding thermal imaging.
